# Qiskit_Mini_Project
## Qiskit:
Qiskit is open-source software for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms. Additionally, several domain specific application APIâ€™s exist on top of this core module.

The central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers, regardless of their skill level or area of interest; Qiskit allows one to easily design experiments and applications and run them on real quantum computers and/or classical simulators. Qiskit is already in use around the world by beginners, hobbyists, educators, researchers, and commercial companies.

## Task:
Code based -
1. Create a program that builds an oracle for a given string (e.g. given 01101, will
return a QuantumCircuit that inverts the phase of the state |01101> and leaves all
other states unchanged..
